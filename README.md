# Hey, I'm Rob!

I enjoy developing friendly web-based projects for others to experience. Lately I have been working with React via Next.js building a personal blog alongside a new portfolio website. Aside from that project I am working on a number of side-projects/businesses including a wood furniture making business that I started with a friend I met through church.
